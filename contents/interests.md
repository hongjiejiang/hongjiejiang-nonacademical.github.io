Outside of academics, I’m drawn to things that live between rules and imagination—sometimes abstract, sometimes playful, often deeply human.

- **Tabletop Game Design**: I'm currently designing an original board game that blends logical systems with narrative structure—a small world to explore and inhabit.
- **Strategic & Logic Games**: I enjoy Go, Sudoku, and speedcubing. These games give me a sense of flow and focus that feels both sharp and calming.
- **Drumming & Music**: I’ve played drums in a band, and I love the energy and rhythm that music brings. To me, it's a way of expressing emotions and practicing sensitivity to timing and structure.
- **Anime and Fictional Worlds**: I love animation and games for how they expand the boundaries of what we can imagine, often offering new lenses on design, emotion, and structure.
- **Reading and Reflection**: I often read essays that live at the intersection of science, art, and philosophy—and sometimes write down short fragments as a form of self-inquiry.
