***Every heart has stars.***

*“所谓人者，皆为星辰。”*

This line carries two layers of meaning for me.

First, it’s a reminder that every person—regardless of background, status, or recognition—has their own kind of brilliance. It may not always be obvious, but it exists quietly, guiding their path and sometimes illuminating others’. To me, this is a call for humility and a respect for quiet diversity.

Second, I see human relationships as constellations—what we perceive of each other is shaped by projection, perspective, and time. A person may appear a certain way from one angle, yet entirely different from another. This awareness keeps me curious, patient, and slow to judge.

Here I share some of the quiet lights in my own map of stars: interests, small acts of creation, and observations that may not be purposeful—but that help me stay gentle and whole alongside rational pursuit.
